# Oxford Thesis Template
 University of Oxford's LaTeX thesis template... made a little more modern

### About
This template adopts K.A. Gillow's widely used [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-oxford-mathematical-institute-phd-thesis-template/xzvzjnxbmftm) to bring a few modern touches. It is also well-suited to a Thesis by publications, where each chapter is a stand-alone piece. Check out the sample [here](https://github.com/amanmajid/oxford-thesis-template/blob/main/sample_pdf.pdf)!
