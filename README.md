### About
This template adopts K.A. Gillow's widely used [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-oxford-mathematical-institute-phd-thesis-template/xzvzjnxbmftm) and the revised version by [Van Wek et al.](https://github.com/ferdinandvanwyk/oxford-thesis-template) to bring a few modern touches. It is well-suited to a Thesis by publications, where each chapter is a stand-alone piece. Check out the sample [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amanmajid/oxford-thesis-template/main/sample.pdf)!
